# Arthiritis_detector
Repository for Osteoarthritis detection project
The project makes use of deep learning to detect osteoarthritis by analyzing the x-ray photograph of the knee joint. It classifies it into Healthy (0), Doubtful/Minimal (1) or Severe (2).
The classifier has been trained on a kaggle dataset with a resnet18 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.
The model will be improved and deployed under an umbrella project aimed at aiding the elderly in diagnosing health issues with ease.
